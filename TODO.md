can you also ensure `applyStateDelta` function and all functions under it calculates & applying state update completely, correctly, and optimally?

PAGE OPENING RULES:
- Continue directly from the final moment of the previous page.
- First sentence must begin from the immediate aftermath of the selected action.
- Show the next physical, sensory, or mental step taken by the MC.
- Do not skip necessary intermediate actions, movements, or objects.
- Do not jump directly to later consequences if an intermediate action is required.
- Do not recap previous events, but do not skip required connecting actions.
- Maintain continuous time and space unless an intentional scene transition occurs.
- Trust that the reader remembers the previous page and understand how the story moved from it to the current moment.

about momentum calculation: yes, it's derived from previous AI page generation result, mainly based on updated story state and previous momentum
you can see my current`calculateStoryMomentum` function implementation and `CalculateStoryMomentumParams` type (from previous types file)
and yes, it also accounts for previously selected actions (see `calculateDangerLevel` function)

please thoroughly examine and review
tell me if you have any concerns or suggestions

utils/prompt.ts: formatActiveThreads, getThreadState
utils/story.ts: processThreadUpdates
types/story-thread.ts

I want to enhance my story thread system for reader experience, while also keeping it not too complex for AI
here's suggestions from ChatGPT (uploaded)
what's your proposal?

Recent Momentum Trend (from previous 5 pages):
Building (page 4-5) → Rising (page 6-7) → Critical (page 8)

[ ] const validated = ajv.validate(schema, aiResponse);

[ ] validate AI json integrity:

import { z } from "zod";

const UserSchema = z.object({
  user_age: z.number().int().min(18).max(99),
  username: z.string().min(3).max(15)
});

// After calling your LLM API (Groq, Cerebras, etc.)
try {
  const rawJson = JSON.parse(apiResponse.choices[0].message.content);
  const validatedData = UserSchema.parse(rawJson); // Throws if constraints fail
  console.log("Safe and validated data:", validatedData);
} catch (error) {
  console.error("LLM failed constraint validation. Retry or fallback needed.", error);
}

[ ] Consider generate multiverse in parallel instead of 1 big request
[ ] Provider Abstraction Layer:
interface AIProvider {
  generate(request: AIRequest): Promise<AIResponse>;
  stream(request: AIRequest): AsyncIterable<string>;
}

[ ] updateBookGenerationStatus -> update bookGenerations aiProvider & aiModel
[ ] ai-chat add metrics: requestStart, firstTokenReceived, generationFinished (TTFT: 1.3s, Generation: 5.8s, Total: 7.1s)
