config/ai-chat.ts

please evaluate and review my implementation of dynamic AI sampling configurations for generating creative story page in Twistloom (`determineAIConfig` function)
are they correct and optimal if I want the most breathtaking, artistic, and emotionally resonant prose? and is it actually good to differentiate sampling (lower temperature) based on story phase progress, for narrative quality, writing style & language consistency?
please elaborate

determineAIConfig
applyActionConfig

utils/prompt.ts

"Gap 2 — Non-streaming `aiPrompt` has no latency telemetry" is implemented
here's my updated `utils/prompt.ts` (uploaded), I restructured and optimized user prompt even more (moved all static rules into `RULES_PAGE_GENERATION`)

can you continue writing the comprehensive architecture docs to best reflect the latest actual codes?

validate AI json integrity:

import { z } from "zod";

const UserSchema = z.object({
  user_age: z.number().int().min(18).max(99),
  username: z.string().min(3).max(15)
});

// After calling your LLM API (Groq, Cerebras, etc.)
try {
  const rawJson = JSON.parse(apiResponse.choices[0].message.content);
  const validatedData = UserSchema.parse(rawJson); // Throws if constraints fail
  console.log("Safe and validated data:", validatedData);
} catch (error) {
  console.error("LLM failed constraint validation. Retry or fallback needed.", error);
}

paid infra:
[ ] purchase premium AI chat API keys
[ ] migrate: GitHub models 8K context -> Official OpenAI 128K context
[ ] migrate: LRU & in-memory cache (for static configurations or public API metadata) -> Vercel KV or Upstash Redis for true, shared cross-user in-memory storage.
[ ] migrate: serverless environment -> single, always-on server Vercel VPS alternative (like Render, Railway, or Fly.io) if you want a true, traditional single-instance server.
